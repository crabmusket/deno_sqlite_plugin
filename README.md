# deno sqlite plugin :seedling:

Bindings to [rusqlite](https://github.com/jgallagher/rusqlite) for [deno](https://deno.land).

## Stability

**NOT PRODUCTION READY** :rotating_light:

This plugin **will panic** if anything goes slightly wrong.
Probably don't use it in production just yet.

**COMPATIBILITY** ðŸ¦•

This plugin has been tested against Deno v1.0.0.

However, Deno's plugin API is not yet stable, so minor version changes to Deno may affect this plugin's usability.
I will endeavour to maintain compatibility as new versions of Deno change its plugin API.

## Usage

First, download the compiled plugin (~2MB).
If you're not using Linux, you will have to compile from source for now (see below).

```bash
wget https://github.com/crabmusket/deno_sqlite_plugin/releases/download/v0.4/libdeno_sqlite_plugin.so
```

Now copy this to `sqlite.ts`:

```ts
import { Sqlite } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crabmusket/deno_sqlite_plugin/v0.4/src/mod.ts";

Deno.openPlugin("./libdeno_sqlite_plugin.so");

const sqlite = new Sqlite();
const db = await sqlite.connect(":memory:");

await db.execute(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS podcasts (
    name TEXT,
    subject TEXT
  )
`);

await db.execute(
  `
    INSERT INTO podcasts (name, subject)
    VALUES (?, ?), (?, ?), (?, ?)
  `,
  [
    ["Econtalk", "economics"],
    ["Random Shipping Forecast", "shipping"],
    ["Revolutions", "revolutions"],
  ].flat(),
);

console.log(
  await db.query("SELECT name, subject FROM podcasts", []),
);

```

And then run the script:

```bash
$ deno run --unstable --allow-plugin sqlite.ts
[
 [ "Econtalk", "economics" ],
 [ "Random Shipping Forecast", "shipping" ],
 [ "Revolutions", "revolutions" ]
]
```

## Auto-download plugin

You can also import `prepared.ts` to fetch the plugin transparently using [plugin_prepare](https://github.com/manyuanrong/deno-plugin-prepare).
Replace the top line of the example above with:

```ts
import { Sqlite } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/crabmusket/deno_sqlite_plugin/v0.4/src/prepared.ts";
```

This may be more ergonomic if you want to use Sqlite in a library that others will depend on.

## Build from source

Install Rust (I recommend [rustup](https://rustup.rs/)) and [deno](https://deno.land/#install) and build with Cargo:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

This will take a few minutes.
A release build will use a few hundred MB of disk space, and a debug build (if you don't specify the `--release` flag) may use up to 600MB.

After you compile, I recommend `strip`ping Linux libraries:

```bash
strip ./target/release/libdeno_sqlite_plugin.so
```

This will reduce the filesize from ~10MB to ~2MB.

## When would I use this?

Use this plugin whenever you would embed an SQLite database into any other program.
It's essentially just a JavaScript wrapper around a Rust wrapper around the actual SQLite C code.

[deno-sqlite](https://github.com/dyedgreen/deno-sqlite), which is awesome, works in browsers; this plugin _does not_.
This plugin _does_ allow you to work with SQLite databases from the filesystem with all the durability and performance SQLite provides.
Wasm-based SQLite ports require you to load the entire database file into memory, operate on it, then save the whole thing back to disk again.

SQLite is [_very good_](https://sqlite.org/testing.html).
You might not always need a remote database like MySQL or Postgres.
But if you do, check out [deno_mysql](https://github.com/manyuanrong/deno_mysql) or [deno-postgres](https://github.com/buildondata/deno-postgres).

## Security

There's a lot of discussion about Deno's [security model](https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/permissions) and how it can help application developers.

Be aware that when running with the `--use-plugin` flag which is required in order to use this plugin, all code running inside your script (including 3rd-party code) may call `Deno.openPlugin` and open arbitrary plugins.
The current plugin API does not seem to respect `--allow-read` whitelisting.
However, the code cannot download plugins from the internet (unless you allow it to with `--allow-net`), so the application can only load plugins that already exist on your filesystem.

When running, Deno's permissions API does not apply to the plugin code.
So, for example, even if you don't specify `--allow-write`, this plugin can be used to create SQLite files in arbitrary locations on disk.

## How does it work?

Query parameters are encoded to JSON text and sent from deno's JS runtime to the plugin.
The plugin decodes the JSON then performs the query against SQLite using rusqlite.
It then re-encodes the result as JSON and sends it back to JS-land.

SQLite's [BLOB type](https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html) is encoded using base64 for transmission via JSON and exposed in the deno interface as an [ArrayBuffer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/ArrayBuffer).
(It might be nice to use a binary serialisation format like CBOR instead of JSON to avoid the base64 encode/decode on either side.)

## TODO

- [ ] Add checks/warnings for Deno version within the code, since plugin API may be unstable
- [ ] Please don't look at any of my code, it's awful
- [ ] Remove all uses of `unwrap()` in Rust; pass errors to JS gracefully
- [ ] Test performance of JSON serialisation for ops and investigate CBOR
- [ ] Implement more [connection methods](https://docs.rs/rusqlite/0.21.0/rusqlite/struct.Connection.html)?
- [ ] What are the implications of using `thread_local!` for `CONNECTION_MAP`?
- [ ] [Embed version](https://stackoverflow.com/a/27841363)
- [ ] Improve [docs](https://doc.deno.land/https/raw.githubusercontent.com/crabmusket/deno_sqlite_plugin/master/src/mod.ts)
- [ ] Use Deno's resource table instead of maintaining a connection map
- [ ] Tests ðŸ˜¬
